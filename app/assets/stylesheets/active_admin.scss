// SASS variable overrides must be declared before loading up Active Admin's styles.
//
// To view the variables that Active Admin provides, take a look at
// `app/assets/stylesheets/active_admin/mixins/_variables.scss` in the
// Active Admin source.
//
// For example, to change the sidebar width:
// $sidebar-width: 242px;

// Active Admin's got SASS!
//@import "active_admin/mixins";
//@import "active_admin/base";
// I've had to remove the above 2 lines (that import the css) because it overrides the css for pagy (and generally it's annoying that we have active admin css leaking into the app). I can't find a solution for rails 6.

// Overriding any non-variable SASS must be done after the fact.
// For example, to change the default status-tag color:
//
//   .status_tag { background: #6090DB; }
