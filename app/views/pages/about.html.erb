      <h2 class="about-title">About</h2>
      <p>Hey I'm Rob, I'm a ex-recruiter turned Ruby developer and the owner of PrimoDev.</p>

      <p>I believe there are 4 painful things about finding your first job as a software developer when you don't have a computer science degree.</p>

      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Finding jobs advertised that don't ask for a Computer Science (or STEM degree).
          </li>
          <li>
            Knowing where to look on the internet for job adverts, without missing any jobs that would be suitable for you to apply to, and then manually checking them every day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Knowing the different keywords (e.g. software engineer/software developer/web developer, junior/jr./trainee) and then ensuring you capture all the possible combinations on each site so that you don't miss any suitable jobs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having a portfolio/cv that demonstrates the experience and qualities that will make you attractive to a company.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>I was in this position a couple of years ago. I felt so demotivated by how many jobs asked for a degree or 6 months - 2 years experience, and so tired of manually going onto each job board and running every search every day.</p>

      <p>I had worked as a tech recruiter for 3 years before becoming a developer and even though I knew the market very well, it was still a very painful process.</p>

      <p>I've created PrimoDev to help reduce these 4 pain points. Right now we're tackling pain points 1-3. We get jobs from all the places I can find that look suitable and collate them into 1 easy to view portal. Irrelevant jobs are filtered out,
        and jobs that ask for degrees or experience aren't included by default (but can be included with the filters available).</p>

      <p>By using DevPrimo, I hope to save you a lot of pain, time and effort finding suitable jobs which you can spend on making better applications or improving your portfolio instead.</p>

      <p>Any questions, feedback or thoughts feel free to contact me on rob@primodev.co.uk.</p>
