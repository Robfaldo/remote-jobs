      To help people who do not have a computer science degree get their first software developer job.

      <h2 class="about-title">About</h2>
      <p>Hey, I'm Rob and I created this website. </p>
      <p>I was in your shoes about 3 years ago and now I'm a mid-level Ruby developer working for an insure-tech company in London.</p>
      <p>Before becoming a software developer I worked in recruitment for 5 years, including 3 years recruiting software developers in a large tech firm.</p>
      <p>I've been on both sides of the table - as someone hiring people looking for their first developer job and as someone who has gone through that process themselves.</p>
      <p>Finding your first developer job can be hard physically, mentally and emotionally. I want to use all my personal experience as a recruiter & career changer to make it easier for you.</p>
